# TrafficSignFlax
Hi, In this project we will be creating a classification model for traffic signs using JAX and FLAX.

JAX is a framework which is used for high-performance computing and machine learning research developed at Google Research. It has a NumPy-consitent API and focuses on differentiating, vectorizing, parallelizing, and compiling GPU/TPU Just-In-Time. JAX is hardware agnostic and meant for speed.

FLAX is a JAX-based neural network library that was initially developed by Google Research's Brain Team. It allows us to more easily design and train neural networks. FLAX does not have any dataloaders so for that we will be using PyTorch.
